``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
Problem1 <- early_january_weather
variable.names(Problem1)
```

    ##  [1] "origin"     "year"       "month"      "day"        "hour"      
    ##  [6] "temp"       "dewp"       "humid"      "wind_dir"   "wind_speed"
    ## [11] "wind_gust"  "precip"     "pressure"   "visib"      "time_hour"

``` r
nrow(Problem1)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(Problem1)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
mean(Problem1$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

- There are 15 variables in this dataset. They are origin, year, month,
  day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
  pressure, visib, and time_hour. Using nrow, we can know that there are
  358 observations. Using ncol, we can know there are 15 variables. The
  mean temperature in this dataset is 39.58. \*\*\*

``` r
ggp_problem1= ggplot(Problem1, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+geom_point()
ggsave("HW1P1ggp.pdf",ggp_problem1, width=8, height=6)
```

\*This scatter plot shows the variation of temperature throughout
January over time. The temperature fluctuates every day and there is no
discernible trend. However, the temperature is generally higher during
the day and lower at night. The period with higher humidity occurs more
frequently in the middle of January.

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
